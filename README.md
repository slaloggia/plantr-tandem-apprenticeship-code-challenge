## `Plantr`
Plantr creates a simple, easy-to-read schedule that shows which of your plants should be watered each day.

Weekends not included. Why are you in the office? It's Saturday, go home.

To view Plantr, navigate to the directory (plantr-tandem-apprenticeship-code-challenge), and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Use the arrow buttons to change the date in view.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />


### `Potential Features`
For this challenge, a default Start Date was specified, but
future versions could include a calendar selector allowing users to choose their own start date.

This interface could also be modified to connect with a backend database (in Rails or similar) to allow users to persist their own data, add or delete plants,
and customize the information stored/displayed for each plant.
